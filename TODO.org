* compaction
** TODO allow using compaction result easily
** TODO -d <comma-separated list> (instead of repeating -d)
** TODO progress indication for smart compaction
since it can be horribly long
possibly auto-abort
** smarter compaction
*** find widest line, try moving down nodes to reduce it
*** allow moving subtrees horizontally
* features
** DONE allow rescaling graphic display
Graphics.set_text_size is not implemented but Graphics.set_font is

xlsfonts show available fonts

lucida is available in sizes 8,10,12,14,18,24
and shapes (normal), bold, bolditalic, italic, typewriter,
typewriter-bold

The following one looks more interesting since it can display much
smaller characters (usefull for big trees)

-misc-fixed-medium-r-normal-- sizes: 6; 7; 8; 9; 10; 13; 14; 15; 18; 20
(7/8, 9/10, 13/14 and 15/18 have same length)

see file fonts.ml

Graphics.resize_window is ok

** DONE allow sliding graphic display
but we don't know screen size
see xrandr(3) maybe

also http://tronche.com/gui/x/xlib/display/screen-information.html

** TODO split wide tree in several horizontal sections
** TODO variable node height

* old stuff
move .tree and .eps in subdir(s)

load text file -- doesn't complain in not fully loaded (see ifelse.tree)

export eps: %%Title: 

doc: auto.eps as auto compaction

adapt scale for latex text sizes: 1 tex point = 0.351 mm
fig export : grey box
node as eps files
 - add extbox to pictures
     on graphics, represent as box with file name
     on xfig possible to strech them...
   
* problem with fig2dev -Leps ?
fig scale 0.06299
the scalefont values are incorrect
ex, for 10pt courier, 150, should be 158.755...


- -d not applied if -c present

- height false with bf if root moved down

- export as fig file (for all other exports through fig2dev, including
  latex text)

- choice of font for labels
- colors

- label centering policy

- mixed policies

- smarter automatic compaction

- different style for leaves and internal nodes
- root on left or right of screen


DONE
- fill label as grey box
- align leaves
- align leaves by moving down maximum subtrees (instead of leaves
  alone)
- align leaves by vertical centering
- root on bottom of screen
- smart has doublons ! FIXED mset_equal
- sort results of auto compact

- smart misses node 6 alone on manual.tree !
  -> à cause des noeuds triés dans le mset... OK ajout dans fin
     systématique


----
fig2dev

-p for pstex_t to include pstex file...

fig2dev -Lpstex_t -p toto.pstex toto.fig > toto.pstex_t
fig2dev -Lpstex                 toto.fig > toto.pstex
