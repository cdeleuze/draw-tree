pstricks trees (part VIII of documentation)

treefit=tight|loose are our compact and normal modes?

plus nice features!

* bugs
** compile text.cmi?
text.mli useless?
** text cut in x11 display
too high...

** DONE text cut in eps export
text at bottom of bounding box (eg CS130/fhs2.eps)
Pictures.bb_cmd 0,10 -> -2,8

** DONE windows: does not clear graphics window before redrawing
apparently because of resize_window does not work
=> added call to clear_graph

** DONE windows: font size is bigger
refwidth and charwidth computed at runtime
** DONE windows: text misplaced
too high for above edges
too high and slightly too large for label box

draw text 4 pixels lower is better (draw_node)

=> the box is too small: it is not scaled in height (fixed height
[-4,16] in draw_node)!

=> still don't know why the box may not be large enough
   (rounding error in x_?)

maybe these vb, vu, and v parameters must be cleaned-up

** windows: resize_window does not work
at least on XP

* details
** Fill_rect in main.draw_node
not exactly vertically aligned (a bit too high).
but shifting down 1 makes it worse

* compaction
** TODO allow using compaction result easily
** TODO -d <comma-separated list> (instead of repeating -d)
** TODO progress indication for smart compaction
since it can be horribly long
possibly auto-abort
** smarter compaction
*** find widest line, try moving down nodes to reduce it
*** allow moving subtrees horizontally
* text format
add leading dot
ignore lines w/o it
later, process them as node attributes

currently, ignore leading dot

* emacs mode
hilight siblings

* features
** TODO nodes of different kinds
define styles for kind of nodes
label nodes for their kind (or tags)

eg node names ending in / or not

kind as first character on line?

** TODO still better options for va,vb, and v
- specify va and vb at once
- specify vertical length of edge slanted part 
** TODO interactive setting of options
** TODO test on cygwin
** DONE better options for -vu and -vb
at least simple settings
  for -vb = -v && -vu = 0
  and -vb = -v - x && -vu = x

** DONE allow rescaling graphic display
Graphics.set_text_size is not implemented but Graphics.set_font is

xlsfonts show available fonts

lucida is available in sizes 8,10,12,14,18,24
and shapes (normal), bold, bolditalic, italic, typewriter,
typewriter-bold

The following one looks more interesting since it can display much
smaller characters (usefull for big trees)

-misc-fixed-medium-r-normal-- sizes: 6; 7; 8; 9; 10; 13; 14; 15; 18; 20
(7/8, 9/10, 13/14 and 15/18 have same length)

see file fonts.ml

Graphics.resize_window is ok

** DONE allow sliding graphic display
but we don't know screen size
see xrandr(3) maybe

also http://tronche.com/gui/x/xlib/display/screen-information.html

** TODO split wide tree in several horizontal sections
** TODO variable node height
** TODO node annotation
label possibly has annotation
drawn below main label, size not taken into account

node label [annotation] <bb> ?

text:make_node computes node bb => easy
+ need to store label+annotation for drawing...

tree.ml is polymorphic
define node as a record width label and annotation (and others)
=> how to include that as picture element?
two text elements?

** TODO subtree folding
on the graphic display, by clicking on a node

** TODO pdf export
* fonts
** select ps font
ps font is (pictures.ml)
let default_font = "Courier";;
let default_font_size = 10;;

could be parameterizable...

other possible fonts
Helvetica
Helvetica-Bold
Times
...
but are not fixed width...
don't play nice with text background box

** DONE in pict_of_tree, char width is taken as 6. (function x_)
X11 default font indeed has a char width of 6.

=> need to dynamically test that!

* old stuff
move .tree and .eps in subdir(s)

load text file -- doesn't complain in not fully loaded (see ifelse.tree)

export eps: %%Title: 

doc: auto.eps as auto compaction

adapt scale for latex text sizes: 1 tex point = 0.351 mm
fig export : grey box
node as eps files
 - add extbox to pictures
     on graphics, represent as box with file name
     on xfig possible to strech them...
   
* problem with fig2dev -Leps ?
fig scale 0.06299
the scalefont values are incorrect
ex, for 10pt courier, 150, should be 158.755...


- -d not applied if -c present

- height false with bf if root moved down

- export as fig file (for all other exports through fig2dev, including
  latex text)

- choice of font for labels
- colors

- label centering policy

- mixed policies

- smarter automatic compaction

- different style for leaves and internal nodes
- root on left or right of screen


DONE
- fill label as grey box
- align leaves
- align leaves by moving down maximum subtrees (instead of leaves
  alone)
- align leaves by vertical centering
- root on bottom of screen
- smart has doublons ! FIXED mset_equal
- sort results of auto compact

- smart misses node 6 alone on manual.tree !
  -> à cause des noeuds triés dans le mset... OK ajout dans fin
     systématique

fig2dev

-p for pstex_t to include pstex file...

fig2dev -Lpstex_t -p toto.pstex toto.fig > toto.pstex_t
fig2dev -Lpstex                 toto.fig > toto.pstex
