** TODO allow rescaling graphic display
** DONE allow sliding graphic display
** TODO split wide tree in several horizontal sections
* old stuff
move .tree and .eps in subdir(s)

load text file -- doesn't complain in not fully loaded (see ifelse.tree)

export eps: %%Title: 

doc: auto.eps as auto compaction

adapt scale for latex text sizes: 1 tex point = 0.351 mm
fig export : grey box
node as eps files
 - add extbox to pictures
     on graphics, represent as box with file name
     on xfig possible to strech them...
   
* problem with fig2dev -Leps ?
fig scale 0.06299
the scalefont values are incorrect
ex, for 10pt courier, 150, should be 158.755...


- -d not applied if -c present

- height false with bf if root moved down

- export as fig file (for all other exports through fig2dev, including
  latex text)

- choice of font for labels
- colors

- label centering policy

- mixed policies

- smarter automatic compaction

- different style for leaves and internal nodes
- root on left or right of screen


DONE
- fill label as grey box
- align leaves
- align leaves by moving down maximum subtrees (instead of leaves
  alone)
- align leaves by vertical centering
- root on bottom of screen
- smart has doublons ! FIXED mset_equal
- sort results of auto compact

- smart misses node 6 alone on manual.tree !
  -> à cause des noeuds triés dans le mset... OK ajout dans fin
     systématique

fig2dev

-p for pstex_t to include pstex file...
